# Batch Gaussian Filtering for Image Denoising

## Project Overview

This project performs **batch image processing** by applying a **5Ã—5 Gaussian blur** to grayscale `.tif` and `.tiff` images. It is designed to process **hundreds of small images** or **dozens of large ones**, making it suitable for enterprise-scale workloads. The Gaussian filter smooths the images, reducing noise and detail.

The project was developed as part of the **CUDA at Scale for the Enterprise** course, though this implementation uses CPU-based OpenCV filtering. It serves as a baseline for potential GPU-accelerated versions using CUDA or NPP.
